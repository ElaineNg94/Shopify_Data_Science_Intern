## Question 1

**A) Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.**

The calculation could be wrong because it might not be for just one item in the order. The customer may have ordered multiple items to get that large price tag.

**B) What metric would you report for this dataset?**

Since we know they only sell one type of shoe, I would divide the total order_amount with the amount of total_items sold to get a better idea of each shoe since they all **_should_** be the same price.

**C) What is its value?**

**$357.92** is the value for the shoes.
